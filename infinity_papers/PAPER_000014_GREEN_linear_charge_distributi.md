## Infinity Token Narrative
This research paper is generated by the Infinity OS using your existing scraped archives
as substrate. It does not copy external content — instead it interprets your stored data
through hydrogen quantum logic, color lattices, and frequency mapping.

## Linear Charge Distribution

Infinity OS treats **linear charge distribution** as a hydrogen-linked node. Its color
pathways inform the operating system where this concept connects inside the lattice.
