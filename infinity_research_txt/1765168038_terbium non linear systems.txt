Mercury (Hg) pollution can negatively impact ecosystems, and there is a need for simple Hg 2+ monitoring platforms. Here, a dual-ligand fluorescence probe based on terbium-organic gels (Tb-L 0.2 P 0.8 MOGs) was constructed for efficient Hg 2+ detection. Tb-L 0.2 P 0.8 MOGs were developed through a facile room-temperature gelation method, showing two emission peaks derived from luminol and Tb 3+ at 424 nm and 544 nm, respectively. The aggregation-induced emission (AIE) effect between luminol and Tb 3+ led to luminol with blue fluorescence. However, Hg 2+ could dramatically quench the fluorescence signal of luminol at 424 nm because of the intense coordination interaction of Hg 2+ with luminol and photo-induced electron transfer (PET). The Phen ligand could sensitize the luminescence of Tb 3+ and offer a reference fluorescence, thus resulting in a unique ratiometric fluorescence response toward Hg 2+ . This novel nanoprobe had excellent linearity with Hg 2+ concentrations range of 0.1-30 μM; the detection limit was 3.6 nM. The analysis of real samples showed the potential application of MOGs for measuring Hg 2+ in porphyra and tap water. Mixed ligands were introduced for high-efficiency strategies to improve the analytical performance by regulating the emission behavior of MOGs.

Terbium-based metal-organic frameworks (Tb-MOF) prepared under mild conditions was utilized to construct a fluorescence probe for determination of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) coupled with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), acetylcholine chloride (Ach), and choline oxidase (CHO). Since OPs have obvious inhibition on the activity of AChE in the Tb-MOF/ACh/CHO/AChE system, the detection of OPs was accomplished by restoring the fluorescence of Tb-MOF resulting from reduced production of H 2 O 2 . By taking chlorpyrifos (CPF) as a pesticide model, the method exhibits high sensitivity in the linear range 0.1-4.0 μg·L -1 with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.04 μg·L -1 under optimum conditions (λ ex = 280 nm, λ em = 544 nm). The Tb-MOF/ACh/CHO/AChE fluorescence system has high selectivity for CPF. The method was successfully applied to the detection of CPF in tap water and strawberry samples (recovery of 87.36-115.60% for tap water and 95.04-103.20% for strawberry). Free from complicated fabrication operation, the Tb-MOF-based system is rapid, simple, and stable, which provides a reference and new way for the design of OPs fluorescent probes in the future.

A linear ubiquitin chain, which consists of ubiquitin molecules linked via their N- and C-termini, is formed by a linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) composed of HOIP, HOIL-1L, and SHARPIN, and conjugation of a linear ubiquitin chain on the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) is deeply involved in NF-κB activation induced by various signals. Since abnormal activation of NF-κB is associated with inflammatory disease and malignancy, we searched for an inhibitor of LUBAC by high-throughput screening (HTS) with a Tb(3+)-fluorescein FRET system. As a result, we found that the fungal metabolite gliotoxin inhibits LUBAC selectively by binding to the RING-IBR-RING domain of HOIP, the catalytic center of LUBAC. Gliotoxin has been well-known as an inhibitor of NF-κB activation, though its action mechanism has remained elusive. Here, we show that gliotoxin inhibits signal-induced NF-κB activation by selectively inhibiting LUBAC-mediated linear ubiquitin chain formation.

Atorvastatin calcium is employed as front-line treatment for cardiovascular diseases. According to the international conference on harmonization (ICH) guideline ICH Q3D, elemental impurities can come into drug products from various sources. These elemental impurities do not have any therapeutic benefit to the end-user. On the contrary, it harms the normal physiological system. Class 1 elements like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead are inorganic impurities that can cause toxic effects on the human body. Nickel was used as a catalyst during the synthesis process of atorvastatin calcium. It comes under the Class-2A, can cause toxicity to humans, and must be quantified. A simple, fast, reliable inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric method for the estimation of elemental impurities like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, and nickel in atorvastatin calcium by open sample digestion technique was developed and validated in accordance with ICH Q3D and USP < 232 > and USP <233 > general chapter. Internal standards like indium, terbium, thallium, bismuth and yttrium were used to correct the non-spectral interferences that were generated during analysis. Gold was added to all solutions as it preserves mercury by amalgamation. The system performance was evaluated every time my performing system suitability parameters. The limits for all the elements were fixed in accordance with ICH Q3D. The limit of detection and the limit of quantification for all the five elements were estimated. Method specificity was proven by checking for interferences due to the sample matrix and other elements. Linearity of each element in standards was established from 25% to 200% of sample concentration, and correlation coefficients were found to be not less than 0.999. The accuracy of the method was demonstrated at three spiking levels at 50%, 100%, and 150% of the J-value for all the elements. The recoveries for all elements at each level were within the range of 90-120%. Method precision was proved at 100% J-value. The relative standard deviation of all elements was less than 5%. It concludes that this newly developed and validated reliable inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric method for estimating of elemental impurities like arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, and nickel in atorvastatin calcium was within the permitted limit and suitable for routine use.

We developed a facile detection method of spermine based on the fluorescence (FL) quenching of the ciprofloxacin-Tb3+ complex, which shows astrong green emission. Ciprofloxacin (CP) makes efficient bondings to Tb3+ ion as a linker molecule through carboxylic and ketone groups to form a kind of lanthanide coordination polymer. The addition of spermine that competes with Tb3+ ions for the interaction with CP due to its positive charge brings about weakened coordination linkage of CP and Tb3+. The probe exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity, and good linearity in the range of 2-180 μM with a low limit of detection of 0.17 μM. Moreover, we applied this method on the paper strip test (PST), along with the integration of a smartphone and Arduino-based device. The practical reliability of the developed probe was evaluated on human serum samples with acceptable analytical results.

In this paper, a lanthanide complex-based fluorescent sensor Tb(4-MBA) was developed for the selective recognition of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and the diabetes biomarker β-hydroxybutyric (β-Hb). β-Hb significantly enhanced the fluorescence emission of the Tb(4-MBA) complex at 539 nm. Based on the analysis of the surface electrostatic potential distribution and time-resolved spectra, we speculate that in the reaction system of β-Hb with Tb(4-MBA), β-Hb and Tb(4-MBA) may form a complex through hydrogen bonding interactions, which brings β-Hb closer to Tb 3+ and thus reduces the non-radiative energy loss of the solvent molecules to Tb 3+ and significantly enhances the Tb(4-MBA) fluorescence intensity. The linear range of Tb(4-MBA) for β-Hb was 2-55 μM, and the limit of detection (LOD) was 50.6 nM. This sensor has high sensitivity and selectivity and shows great potential in the field of screening and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and DKA.

Photoluminescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) were grown in a living plant ( Syngonium podophyllum ) via immersing their roots in an aqueous solution of disodium terephthalate and terbium chloride hexahydrate sequentially for 12 h without affecting their viability. Then, app-assisted living MOF-plant nanobiohybrids were used for the detection of various toxic metal ions and organic pollutants. Their performance and sensing mechanism were also evaluated. The results demonstrated that the living plants served as self-powered preconcentrators via their passive fluid transport systems and accumulated the pollutants around the embedded MOFs, resulting in relative changes in fluorescence intensity. Therefore, the living MOF-plant nanobiohybrids initiate superior selectivity and sensitivity (0.05-0.5 μM) in water for Ag + , Cd 2+ , and aniline with a "turn-up" fluorescence response and for Fe 3+ and Cu 2+ with "turn-down" fluorescence response in the linear range of 0.05-10 μM with excellent precision and accuracy of 5 and 10%, respectively. With the easy-to-read visual signals under ultraviolet light, the app translates plant luminescent signals into digital information on a smartphone for on-site monitoring of environmental pollutants with high sensitivity and specificity. These results suggest that interfacing synthetic and living materials may contribute to the development of smart sensors for on-site environmental pollutant sensing with high accuracy.

A simple and fast approach is used for the first time to develop a time resolved lanthanide-sensitized luminescence method for the simultaneous determination of a preservative and a sweetener, namely benzoic acid (BZ) and saccharin (SC), respectively, in food samples. The method involves the formation of the corresponding ternary chelates with terbium(III) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) in the presence of Triton X-100, and the measurement of the initial rate and equilibrium signal of this system, which were obtained in 0.1 and 5 s, respectively. The dynamic ranges of the calibration graphs, obtained by using kinetic and equilibrium measurements, were 0.2-36 micrograms ml-1 and 0.15-30 micrograms ml-1, respectively, for BZ, and 3.3-24 micrograms ml-1 and 4-36 micrograms ml-1 for SC and the detection limits were 0.07 and 0.04 microgram ml-1, respectively, for BZ, and 1.1 and 1.2 micrograms ml-1, respectively, for sodium SC. The relative standard deviation ranged between 2.3 and 3.0%. Both compounds were determined simultaneously by using a system of two equations which were resolved by using the calibration data obtained individually for each analyte and by multiple linear regression. Mixtures of BZ and SC in ratios between 3:1 and 1:9 were satisfactorily resolved by using both approaches. The method was applied to the direct analysis of several soft drinks. Analytical recoveries ranged between 89.3 and 108.5%.

Peptides (33-34 amino acids long) corresponding to the helix-turn-helix (EF-hand) motif of the calcium binding site I of Paramecium tetraurelia calmodulin have been synthesized. The linear sequence was unable to acquire a native-like conformation and calcium binding. However, incorporation of a well-positioned disulfide bond bridging the two putative helical regions greatly improved the ordered structure and binding properties. Analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry, circular dichroism and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence, such a disulfide-stabilized peptide is shown to acquire a calcium-dependent helical conformation and exhibits native-like affinity for calcium, terbium and europium ions with 30+/-1, 3.5+/-0.6 and 0.6+/-0.1 microM dissociation constants, respectively. Comparable affinities were calculated within the biological construct comprising the entire domain I of Arabidopsis taliana calmodulin. Single sequence mutation (Glu25Asp) in the binding loop of the peptide abolishes calcium affinity, but preserves lanthanide affinity, showing that metal selectivity can be modulated by specific mutations. Such disulfide-stabilized peptides represent useful models to engineer metal specificity in new calmodulin proteins, facilitating the development of new systems to monitor metal pollution in biosensors and to increase metal binding capability of bacterial and plant cells in bioremediation techniques.

Following the success of the siderophore-inspired 1,2-hydroxypyridonate (HOPO) and 2-hydroxisophthalamide (IAM) chromophores in Eu(III) and Tb(III) luminescence, we designed three new ligands bearing both chromophores. Syntheses of the octadentate ligands 3,4,3-LI-IAM-1,2-HOPO and 3,4,3-LI-1,2-HOPO-IAM, where the chromophores are attached to different positions in the (LI=linear) spermine backbone, are reported in addition to a tetradentate ligand based on 1,5-diaminopentane. The Gd(III) complexes were prepared and revealed localized triplet states typical for the IAM and HOPO chromophores. Photophysical characterization of the Eu(III) and Tb(III) complexes revealed that the chromophores need to reside at a primary amine of the spermine backbone to be efficient in lanthanide excitation. These systems help us to understand the antenna effect in siderophore inspired chromophores and could be potential targets for sensing and biological imaging applications.
