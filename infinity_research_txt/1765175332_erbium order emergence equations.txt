Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in quantum systems, particularly interesting in 2D where superfluidity emerges via the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism. We observe a superfluid phase with algebraically decaying correlation in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms and further identify the superfluid phase transition by monitoring extended coherence. We also measure equations of state with tunable dipolar interactions. Our findings show a transition point shift due to dipole orientation, aligning with BKT transition with effective short-range interaction. However, we observe that in-plane tilted dipoles show nonlocal effects in the superfluid regime, preventing the effective short-range interaction from revealing universal behavior near the BKT critical point. We also measure anisotropic atom number fluctuations in the superfluid regime, highlighting its dipolar nature. Our results provide a foundation for understanding dipolar bosons in 2D and pave the way for investigating complex orders in dipolar superfluids.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an important and ground-breaking technique in scientific machine learning for numerous applications including in optical fiber communications. However, the vanilla/baseline version of PINNs is prone to fail under certain conditions because of the nature of the physics-based regularization term in its loss function. The use of this unique regularization technique results in a highly complex non-convex loss landscape when visualized. This leads to failure modes in PINN-based modeling. The baseline PINN works very well as an optical fiber model with relatively simple fiber parameters and for uncomplicated transmission tasks. Yet, it struggles when the modeling task becomes relatively complex, reaching very high error, for example, numerous modeling tasks/scenarios in soliton communication and soliton pulse development in special fibers such as erbium-doped dispersion compensating fibers. We implement two methods to circumvent the limitations caused by the physics-based regularization term to solve this problem, namely, the so-called scaffolding technique for PINN modeling and the progressive block learning PINN modeling strategy to solve the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which models pulse propagation in an optical fiber. This helps PINN learn more accurately the dynamics of pulse evolution and increases accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude. We show in addition that this error is not due to the depth or architecture of the neural network but a fundamental issue inherent to PINN by design. The results achieved indicate a considerable reduction in PINN error for complex modeling problems, with accuracy increasing by up to two orders of magnitude.
