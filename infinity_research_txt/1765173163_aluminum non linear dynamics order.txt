The molecular basis of adhesion leading to sticking was investigated by exploring the correlation between thermal analysis and molecular simulations. It is hypothesized that intermolecular interactions between a drug molecule and a punch face are the first step in the adhesion process and the rank order of adhesion during tablet compression should correspond to the rank order of the energies of these interactions. In the present study, the sticking propensity was investigated using ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen as model substances. At the intermolecular level, a thermal analysis model was proposed as an experimental technique to estimate the work of adhesion between ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen in a DSC aluminum pan. The linear relationship was established between the enthalpy of vaporization and sample mass to demonstrate the accuracy of the instruments used. The threshold mass for ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen was determined to be 107, 112, and 222 μg, respectively, after three replicate measurements consistent with the experimental results. Ketoprofen showed a 2-fold higher threshold mass compared to ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, which predicts that ketoprofen should have the highest sticking propensity. Computationally, the rank order of the work of adhesion between ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, and ketoprofen with the metal surface was simulated to be -75.91, 44.75, and -96.91 kcal/mol, respectively, using Materials Studio. The rank order of the interaction between the drug molecule and the iron superlattice decreases in the order ketoprofen > ibuprofen > flurbiprofen. The results indicate that the thermal model can be successfully implemented to assess the sticking propensity of a drug at the molecular level. Also, a new molecular simulation script was successfully applied to determine the interaction energy of the drug molecule upon contact with iron.

Finite element (FE) models accurately compute the mechanical response of bone and bone-like materials when the models include their detailed microstructure. In order to simulate non-linear behavior, which currently is only feasible at the expense of extremely high computational costs, coarser models can be used if the local morphology has been linked to the apparent mechanical behavior. The aim of this paper is to implement and validate such a constitutive law. This law is able to capture the non-linear structural behavior of bone-like materials through the use of fabric tensors. It also allows for irreversible strains using an elastoplastic material model incorporating hardening. These features are expressed in a constitutive law based on the anisotropic continuum damage theory coupled with isotropic elastoplasticity in a finite strain framework. This material model was implemented into metafor (LTAS-MNNL, University of Liège, Belgium), a non-linear FE software. The implementation was validated against experimental data of cylindrical samples subjected to compression. Three materials with bone-like microstructure were tested: aluminum foams of variable density (ERG, Oakland, CA, USA), polylactic acid foam (CERM, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium), and cancellous bone tissue of a deer antler (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium).

We investigate the contribution of inelastic electron collisions to nonlinear (NL) dynamics in ultraviolet plasmonic nanoparticles, exploring their potential for harmonic generation. Employing the Landau weak coupling formalism to model radiation-driven electron dynamics in sodium and aluminum, we account for both electron-electron and electron-phonon scattering processes by a set of hydrodynamic equations, which we solve perturbatively to obtain third-order NL susceptibilities. Furthermore, we model high harmonic generation enhanced by localized surface plasmons in nanospheres composed of such poor metals, demonstrating their efficient operation for extreme ultraviolet generation. Our investigation reveals that plasmonic nanospheres composed of sodium and aluminum produce a large field intensity enhancement of ≃103-105, boosting the harmonic generation process. Our findings indicate that poor metals hold great promise for advanced extreme ultraviolet nano-sources with potential applications in nano-spectroscopy.

Sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) is an intrinsically surface-selective vibrational spectroscopic technique based on the second-order nonlinear optical process. Since its birth in the 1980s, SFG-VS has been used to solve interfacial structure and dynamics in a variety of research fields including chemistry, physics, materials sciences, biological sciences, environmental sciences, etc. Better understanding of SFG-VS instrumentation is no doubt an essential step to master this sophisticated technique. To address this need, here we will present a Tutorial with respect to the classification, setup layout, construction, operation, and data processing about SFG-VS. We will focus on the steady state Ti:sapphire based broad bandwidth SFG-VS system and use it as an example. We hope this Tutorial is beneficial for newcomers to the SFG-VS field and for people who are interested in using SFG-VS technique in their research.

A theoretical analysis of nanoscale pore formation during anodization reveals its fundamental instability mechanism to be a field focusing phenomenon when perturbations on the minima of the two oxide interfaces are in phase. Lateral leakage of the layer potential at high wave number introduces a layer tension effect that balances the previous destabilizing effect to produce a long-wave instability and a selected pore separation that scales linearly with respect to voltage. At pH higher than 1.77, pores do not form due to a very thick barrier layer. A weakly nonlinear theory based on long-wave expansion of double free surface problem yields two coupled interface evolution equations that can be reduced to one without altering the dispersion relationship by assuming an equal and in-phase amplitude for the two interfaces. This interface evolution equation faithfully reproduces the initial pore ordering and their dynamics. A hodograph transformation technique is then used to determine the interior dimension of the well-developed pores in two dimensions. The ratio of pore diameter to pore separation is found to be a factor independent of voltage but varies with the pH of the electrolyte. Both the predicted pH range where pores are formed and the predicted pore dimensions are favorably compared to experimental data. (c) 2002 American Institute of Physics.

The measurement of stress in a structure presents considerable interest in many fields of engineering. In this paper, the diagnostic potential of nonlinear elastic guided waves in a prestressed plate is investigated. To do so, an analytical model is formulated accounting for different aspects involved in the phenomenon. The fact that the initial strains can be finite is considered using the Green Lagrange strain tensor, and initial and final configurations are not merged, as it would be assumed in the infinitesimal strain theory. Moreover, an appropriate third-order expression of the strain energy of the hyperelastic body is adopted to account for the material nonlinearities. The model obtained enables to investigate both the linearized case, which gives the variation of phase and group velocity as a function of the initial stress, and the nonlinear case, involving second-harmonic generation as a function of the initial state of stress. The analysis is limited to Rayleigh-Lamb waves propagating in a plate. Three cases of initial prestress are considered, including prestress in the direction of the wave propagation, prestress orthogonal to the direction of wave propagation, and plane isotropic stress.

Resonant optical antennas are ideal for nanoscale nonlinear optical interactions due to their inherent strong local field enhancement. Indeed second- and third-order nonlinear response of gold nanoparticles has been reported. Here we compare the on- and off-resonance properties of aluminum, silver, and gold nanoantennas, by measuring two-photon photoluminescence. Remarkably, aluminum shows 2 orders of magnitude higher luminescence efficiency than silver or gold. Moreover, in striking contrast to gold, the aluminum emission largely preserves the linear incident polarization. Finally, we show the systematic resonance control of two-photon excitation and luminescence polarization by tuning the antenna width and length independently. Our findings point to aluminum as a promising metal for nonlinear plasmonics.

All-optical switches control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light using optical control pulses. They can operate at ultrafast timescales - essential for technology-driven applications like optical computing, and fundamental studies like time-reflection. Conventional all-optical switches have a fixed switching time, but this work demonstrates that the response-time can be controlled by selectively controlling the light-matter-interaction in so-called fast and slow materials. The bi-material switch has a nanosecond response when the probe interacts strongly with titanium nitride near its epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) wavelength. The response-time speeds up over two orders of magnitude with increasing probe-wavelength, as light's interaction with the faster Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) increases, eventually reaching the picosecond-scale near AZO's ENZ-regime. This scheme provides several additional degrees of freedom for switching time control, such as probe-polarization and incident angle, and the pump-wavelength. This approach could lead to new functionalities within key applications in multiband transmission, optical computing, and nonlinear optics.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) in situ has been used to observe the cold disassembly dynamics of microtubules at a previously unrealised spatial resolution. Microtubules either electrostatically or covalently bound to aminosilane surfaces disassembled at room temperature under buffer solutions with no free tubulin present. This process was followed by taking sequential tapping-mode AFM images and measuring the change in the microtubule end position as a function of time, with an spatial accuracy down to +/-20nm and a temporal accuracy of +/-1s. As well as giving average disassembly rates on the order of 1-10 tubulin monomers per second, large fluctuations in the disassembly rate were revealed, indicating that the process is far from smooth and linear under these experimental conditions. The surface bound rates measured here are comparable to the rates for GMPCPP-tubulin microtubules free in solution, suggesting that inhibition of tubulin curvature through steric hindrance controls the average, relatively low disassembly rate. The large fluctuations in this rate are thought to be due to multiple pathways in the kinetics of disassembly with differing rate constants and/or stalling due to defects in the microtubule lattice. Microtubules that were covalently bound to the surface left behind the protofilaments covalently cross-linked to the aminosilane via glutaraldehyde during the disassembly process. Further work is needed to quantitatively assess the effects of surface binding on protofibril disassembly rates, reveal any differences in disassembly rates between the plus and minus ends and to enable assembly as well as disassembly to be imaged in the microscope fluid cell in real-time.

Nonlinear modal analysis is a demanding yet imperative task to rigorously address real-life situations where the dynamics involved clearly exceed the limits of linear approximation. The specific case of geometric nonlinearities, where the effects induced by the second and higher-order terms in the strain-displacement relationship cannot be neglected, is of great significance for structural engineering in most of its fields of application-aerospace, civil construction, mechanical systems, and so on. However, this nonlinear behaviour is strongly affected by even small changes in stiffness or mass, e.g., by applying physically-attached sensors to the structure of interest. Indeed, the sensors placement introduces a certain amount of geometric hardening and mass variation, which becomes relevant for very flexible structures. The effects of mass loading, while highly recognised to be much larger in the nonlinear domain than in its linear counterpart, have seldom been explored experimentally. In this context, the aim of this paper is to perform a noncontact, full-field nonlinear investigation of the very light and very flexible XB-1 air wing prototype aluminum spar, applying the well-known resonance decay method. Video processing in general, and a high-speed, optical target tracking technique in particular, are proposed for this purpose; the methodology can be easily extended to any slender beam-like or plate-like element. Obtained results have been used to describe the first nonlinear normal mode of the spar in both unloaded and sensors-loaded conditions by means of their respective backbone curves. Noticeable changes were encountered between the two conditions when the structure undergoes large-amplitude flexural vibrations.
Keywords: backbone curve; geometric nonlinearity; noncontact measurements; nonlinear dynamics; video processing.
