A new turn-on luminescence energy transfer (LET) system has been designed for the detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA, a cancer marker) that utilizes Mn(2+)-enhanced long wavelength luminescence NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods as the donor and gold nanorods as the acceptor. The Mn(2+)-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion luminescence nanorods with an emission peak located in the red region were synthesized. The presence of Mn(2+) markedly increased the luminescence intensity over that of the NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanomaterials (excited by a 980 nm continuous wavelength laser). The surfaces of Mn(2+)-doped NaYF4:Yb, Er upconversion nanorods were modified with poly(acrylic acid). Antibodies against prostate specific antigen were bound to the surface of the carboxyl-functionalized upconversion nanorods, which acted as the energy donor in this LET system. Gold nanorods with an absorption band at ~666 nm were synthesized by the seed growth method, acted as the energy acceptor. The emission band of the upconversion nanorods overlapped well with the absorption band of the gold nanorods. The luminescence was quenched because of the electrostatic interactions that shortened the distance between the donor (negatively charged) and the accepter (positively charged).When the PSA antigen was added into the system, the energy acceptor and the energy donors were separated because the binding affinity between PSA and anti-PSA was greater than the electrostatic interactions, and thereby the luminescence was recovered. The linear range of detecting PSA was from 0.1172 to 18.75 ng/mL (R=0.995), with a limit of detection for PSA as low as 0.1129 ng/mL. The method was successfully applied to the sensing of PSA in human serum samples.

A novel fluorescence immunoassay to detect fluoroquinolones in animal-derived foods was developed for the first time by use of upconversion nanoparticles as signal-probe labels. The bioassay system was established by the use of coating-antigen-modified polystyrene particles as immune-sensing probes for separation and anti-norfloxacin monoclonal antibody conjugated with carboxyl-functionalized NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles which were prepared via a pyrolysis method and a subsequent ligand exchange process as fluorescent-signal probes (emission intensity recorded at 542 nm with excitation at 980 nm). Under optimized conditions, detection of fluoroquinolones was performed easily. The detection limit of this fluorescence immunoassay for norfloxacin, for example, was 10 pg mL(-1), within a wide linear range of 10 pg mL(-1) to 10 ng mL(-1) (R (2) = 0.9959). For specificity analysis, the data obtained indicate this method could be applied in broad-spectrum detection of fluoroquinolones. The recoveries of norfloxacin-spiked animal-derived foods ranged from 82.37 to 132.22 %, with coefficients of variation of 0.24-25.06 %. The extraction procedure was rapid and simple, especially for milk samples, which could be analyzed directly without any pretreatment. In addition, the results obtained with the method were in good agreement with those obtained with commercial ELISA kits. The fluorescence immunoassay was more sensitive, especially with regard to the detection limit in milk samples (0.01 ng mL(-1) for norfloxacin): it was 50-fold more sensitive than commercial ELISA kits (0.5 ng mL(-1) for norfloxacin). The results show the proposed fluorescence immunoassay was facile, sensitive, and interference free, and is an alternative method for the quantitative detection of fluoroquinolone residues in animal-derived foods.

Background: Prior studies have suggested exposure to heavy metals and endocrine disrupting chemicals could disturb the homeostasis of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), but no epidemiology study concerning the influence of rare earth elements (REE) exposure during pregnancy on neonatal TSH levels. The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between prenatal REE exposure and neonatal TSH levels.
Methods: A total of 7367 pregnant women were recruited from Wuhan Children's Hospital between September 2012 and October 2014 in Wuhan, China. Urinary concentrations of cerium (Ce), and ytterbium (Yb) were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Immunofluorescence assay was used to detect neonatal TSH levels. The associations between REE exposure and neonatal TSH levels were evaluated using multivariate linear regression models.

In this work, we design a FRET system for sensitive and selective determination of thrombin in red region, in which NaYF₄:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) act as donor and gold nanorods (Au NRs) act as acceptor. NaYF₄:Yb,Er UCNPs with a strong emission at 661 nm were successfully synthesized by tuning the doped ions ratio. Carboxyl-functionalized NaYF₄:Yb,Er UCNPs and Au NRs were then prepared and conjugated with the thrombin aptamers, respectively. The fluorescence emission band of NaYF₄:Yb,Er UCNPs (λ(max)=661 nm) highly overlaps with the absorption band of Au NRs(λ(max)=666 nm), which benefits from the large tunability of the spectrum band of Au NRs. A FRET system was then formed when thrombin was added to the mixture of NaYF₄:Yb,Er UCNPs and Au NRs, which were both modified thrombin aptamers. The fluorescence quenching efficiency of NaYF₄:Yb,Er UCNPs was increased in a thrombin concentration-dependent manner, which built the principle of thrombin quantification. The linear range was 2.5-90 nM in an aqueous buffer, and 3.75-112.5 nM in spiked human serum samples for thrombin. It also demonstrates a high selectivity to other biological species due to the specific binding. The measurement of thrombin in human plasma is satisfying, suggesting that the FRET system is of practical value in a complex biological sample matrix in red region.

A novel fluorescence probe based on upconversion particles, YF3:Yb(3+), Er(3+), coating with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs@UCPs) has been synthesized for selective recognition of the analyte clenbuterol (CLB), which was characterized by scan electron microscope and X-ray powder diffraction. The fluorescence of the MIPs@UCPs probe is quenched specifically by CLB, and the effect is much stronger than the NIPs@UCPs (non-imprinting polymers, NIPs). Good linear correlation was obtained for CLB over the concentration range of 5.0-100.0 μg L(-1) with a detection limit of 0.12 μg L(-1) (S/N=3). The developed method was also used in the determination of CLB in water and pork samples, and the recoveries ranged from 81.66% to 102.46% were obtained with relative standard deviation of 2.96-4.98% (n=3). The present study provides a new and general tactics to synthesize MIPs@UCPs fluorescence probe with highly selective recognition ability to the CLB and is desirable for application widely in the near future.
