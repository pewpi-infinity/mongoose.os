Objective: Although the US infant mortality rate reached a record low in 2020, the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) rate increased from 2019. To understand if the increase was related to changing death certification practices or the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we examined sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) rates as a group, by cause, and by race and ethnicity.
Methods: We estimated SUID rates during 2015 to 2020 using US period-linked birth and death data. SUID included SIDS, unknown cause, and accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed. We examined changes in rates from 2019 to 2020 and assessed linear trends during prepandemic (2015-2019) using weighted least squares regression. We also assessed race and ethnicity trends and quantified COVID-19-related SUID.

Background: The universally accepted best practice protocol for monitoring patients who receive intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke was established in the 1990s. However, the protocol is burdensome for nurses, disrupts the sleep of patients, and is potentially less relevant in patients at low risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. We aimed to assess whether implementing a low-intensity monitoring protocol would be as safe and effective as standard high-intensity monitoring for patients with acute ischaemic stroke at low risk.
Methods: OPTIMISTmain was an international, pragmatic, multicentre, stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, blinded-endpoint trial conducted at hospitals (clusters) in eight countries. It was designed to test the non-inferiority of a low-intensity monitoring protocol to a standard protocol among consecutive adults with acute ischaemic stroke who were clinically stable with mild to moderate neurological impairment (score <10 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) within 2 h of initiation of intravenous thrombolysis according to local guidelines. Participating hospitals were randomly allocated to three sequences of implementation across four periods, stratified by country and projected numbers of participants, in which sites switched from standard monitoring (control) to low-intensity monitoring (intervention) in a stepped manner. The low-intensity monitoring protocol included assessments of neurological and vital signs every 15 min for 2 h, every 2 h for 8 h (vs every 30 min for 6 h for standard monitoring), and every 4 h (vs every 1 h for standard monitoring) until 24 h after thrombolysis. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with an unfavourable functional outcome defined by a score from 2 (indicating some disability) to 6 (death) on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days, measured by research staff masked to group allocation. The non-inferiority margin was set at 1·15 for the risk ratio (RR) in the intention-to-treat population. A generalised linear mixed model was used for analysis with adjustments for cluster (hospital site) and time (6-month periods from April, 2021), and imputation of missing outcome data. This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03734640 ) and the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12619001556134p) and is completed.

A simple method for preparing DNA-stabilized Ag nanoclusters (NCs) nanowires is presented. To fabricate the Ag NCs nanowires, we use just two unmodified component strands and a long enzymatically produced scaffold. These nanowires form at room temperature and have periodic sequence units that are available for fluorescence Ag NCs assembled which formed three-way junction (TWJ) structure. These Ag NCs nanowires can be clearly visualized by confocal microscopy. Furthermore, due to the high efficiency of rolling circle amplification reaction in signal amplification, the nanowires exhibit high sensitivity for the specific DNA detection with a wide linear range from 6 to 300 pM and a low detection limit of 0.84 pM, which shows good performance in the complex serum samples. Therefore, these Ag NCs nanowires might have great potential in clinical and imaging applications in the future.

We report surface plasmon (SP) lasing in metal/semiconductor nanostructures, where one-dimensional periodic silver slit gratings are placed on top of an InGaAsP layer. The SP nature of the lasing is confirmed from the emission wavelength governed by the grating period, polarization analysis, spatial coherence, and comparison with the linear transmission. The excellent performance of the device as an SP source is demonstrated by its tunable emission in the 400-nm-wide telecom wavelength band at room temperature. We show that the stimulated emission enhanced by the Purcell effect enables successful SP lasing at high energies above the gap energy of the gain. We also discuss the dependence of the lasing efficiency on temperature, grating dimension, and type of metal.

People who smoke menthol cigarettes, particularly those who are non-Hispanic Black/African American, are less likely to achieve successful smoking cessation compared with people who smoke non-menthol cigarettes. This study examined the 2003-2019 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (TUS-CPS) harmonized data to estimate cross-sectional trends in cigarette smoking cessation among U.S. adults, stratified by menthol cigarette use, race/ethnicity, sex, and age. The analytic sample included respondents who smoked for ≥ 2 years (current users and former users who reported quitting during the past year). We tested cessation trends using orthogonal polynomial contrasts for overall, menthol, and non-menthol smoking cessation prevalence and stratified by race/ethnicity, sex, and age in logistic regression models. We also analyzed the 2018-2019 non-harmonized TUS-CPS data among recent quitters to examine differences in characteristics (e.g., demographic characteristics, smoking frequency, use of smoking cessation aids, switching to other tobacco products) by menthol cigarette use. We observed significant linear changes in prevalence trends for overall cigarette smoking cessation, menthol smoking cessation, and non-menthol smoking cessation (p < 0.0001 for all linear trends), and changes in menthol cessation among non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Other race/ethnicity categories during 2003-2019. In the 2018-2019 wave, we observed differences in menthol status for sex, race/ethnicity, age, and educational attainment. We did not observe differences for other characteristics. We observed changes in overall cigarette smoking cessation, menthol, and non-menthol smoking cessation prevalence during the study period; however, gains in cigarette smoking cessation were not experienced among non-Hispanic Black/African American adults who smoke.

We quantify the oceanic sink for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) over the period 1994 to 2007 by using observations from the global repeat hydrography program and contrasting them to observations from the 1990s. Using a linear regression-based method, we find a global increase in the anthropogenic CO 2 inventory of 34 ± 4 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) between 1994 and 2007. This is equivalent to an average uptake rate of 2.6 ± 0.3 Pg C year -1 and represents 31 ± 4% of the global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions over this period. Although this global ocean sink estimate is consistent with the expectation of the ocean uptake having increased in proportion to the rise in atmospheric CO 2 , substantial regional differences in storage rate are found, likely owing to climate variability-driven changes in ocean circulation.

We performed a kidney biopsy in a 36-year-old man to evaluate microscopic hematuria and proteinuria. Light microscopy showed increased mesangial matrix and partial swelling of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and immunofluorescence showed positive staining only for C3. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that gold particle-labeled C3 was localized in the electron-dense and moderately electron-dense deposits shown by electron microscopy in the mesangium, the thickened GBM near the paramesangium, and the thickened distal portion of the GBM but was not localized in the non-thickened GBM. Gold-labeled immunoglobulin G, κ, and λ were not seen. C3 glomerulonephritis was more evident in gold-labeled electron microscopy, which further clarified the localization of C3 deposition.
Keywords: C3 glomerulonephritis; dense deposit disease; immunoelectron microscopy; immunofluorescence microscopy; light microscopy.

Advair Diskus is an essential treatment for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is a dry powder inhaler with a combination of fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol xinafoate (SX). However, the pharmacokinetics (PK) batch-to-batch variability of the reference-listed drug (RLD) hindered its generic product development. This work developed the PK models for inhaled FP and SX that could represent potential batch variability. Two batches each of the reference and the test product (R 1 , R 2 , T 1 , T 2 ) of Advair Diskus (100 μg FP/50 μg SX inhalation) were administered to 60 healthy subjects in a 4-period, 4-sequence crossover study. The failure of the bioequivalence (BE) between R 1 and R 2 confirmed the high between-batch variability of the RLD. Non-linear mixed effect modeling was used to estimate the population mean PK parameters for each batch. For FP, a 2-compartment model with a sequential dual zero-order absorption best described the PK profile. For SX, a 2-compartment model with a first-order absorption model best fit the data. Both models were able to capture the plasma concentration, the maximum concentration, and the total exposure (AUC inf ) adequately for each batch, which could be used to simulate the BE study in the future. In vitro properties were also measured for each batch, and the batch with a higher fraction of the fine particle (diameter < 1 µm, < 2 µm) had a higher AUC inf . This positive correlation for both FP and SX could potentially assist the batch selection for the PK BE study.

We present an extension of the charge-dipole model for the description of periodic systems. This periodic charge-dipole electrostatic model (PCDEM) allows one to describe the linear response of periodic structures in terms of charge- and dipole-type gaussian basis functions. The long-range electrostatic interaction is efficiently described by means of the continuous fast multipole method. As a first application, the PCDEM method is applied to describe the polarizability of silver slabs. We find that for a correct description of the polarizability of the slabs both charges and dipoles are required. However a continuum set of parametrizations, i.e., different values of the width of charge- and dipole-type gaussians, leads to an equivalent and accurate description of the slabs polarizability but a completely unphysical description of induced charge-density inside the slab. We introduced the integral squared density measure which allows one to obtain a unique parametrization which accurately describes both the polarizability and the induced density profile inside the slab. Finally the limits of the electrostatic approximations are also pointed out.
