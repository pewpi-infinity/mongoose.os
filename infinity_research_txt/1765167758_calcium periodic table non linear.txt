Dietary factors are known to influence urinary fluoride (UF) levels in nonpregnant people. Maternal UF is used as a biomarker of fluoride exposure; however, dietary influences on UF during pregnancy are unknown. We compared UF levels and assessed the associations between UF and five select dietary influences in pregnancy vs. one-year postpartum: dietary fluoride (F), calcium intake from diet (Ca-diet), calcium intake from supplements (Ca-sup), dietary acid load (AL), and table salt use (TS) in 421 women exposed to fluoridated salt in the Mexican diet. Spot UF (mg/L) was measured by microdiffusion/fluoride-specific electrode and dilution-corrected with specific gravity (SG). Dietary variables were estimated from a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Comparisons among UF in pregnancy vs. one-year postpartum were performed with non-parametric tests. Associations between dietary variables and UF were assessed using random effect models (for pregnancy) and linear regression (for one-year postpartum). SG-corrected UF (median, range) during pregnancy (0.77, 0.01-4.73 mg/L) did not significantly differ from one-year postpartum (0.75, 0.15-2.62 mg/L) but did increase every 10 gestational weeks, β = 0.05 (CI: 0.00-0.10). Different dietary influences on UF were identified at each state. Although Ca-diet and AL were not associated with UF in either state, Ca-sup decreased UF only during pregnancy, β = - 0.012 mg/L (CI: - 0.023-0.00). Reporting TS use was associated with 12% increase in UF only at one-year postpartum (p = 0.026). These results suggest different dietary influences on UF in the pregnant state, which need consideration when using UF as a biomarker of fluoride exposure.

Background: In some studies, high calcium intake has been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, but no randomized studies have investigated this issue.
Methods: We randomly assigned 672 men to receive either 3 g of calcium carbonate (1,200 mg of calcium), or placebo, daily for 4 years in a colorectal adenoma chemoprevention trial. Participants were followed for up to 12 years and asked periodically to report new cancer diagnoses. Subject reports were verified by medical record review. Serum samples, collected at randomization and after 4 years, were analyzed for 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D, 25-(OH) vitamin D, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). We used life table and Cox proportional hazard models to compute rate ratios for prostate cancer incidence and generalized linear models to assess the relative risk of increases in PSA levels.

During the weaning period, solid foods are introduced in the diet to complement human milk or infant formula. Consequently, marginal deficiencies may easily develop because of inappropriate feeding and low bioavailability of nutrients. The objective of this study was to determine calcium, iron and zinc availability from weaning foods that contained a variety of ingredients but almost the same dietary fibre content, and to describe dietary factors that influence availability in a linear matter. Availability measurements from eight meals were made in vitro by a continuous-flow dialysis system with preliminary intraluminal digestion. Calcium, iron and zinc were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry; ascorbic acid content was taken from food-composition tables; and macronutrient and mineral contents were obtained from the manufacturer. Calcium availability was higher in fruits (mean +/- SD, 39.2 +/- 4.1%) than vegetables (31.7 +/- 5.8%) (p < or = 0.001). Iron availability was marginally significant higher in vegetables (13.0 +/- 4.7%) than fruits (10.2 +/- 1.6%) (p = 0.027). Zinc availability showed higher availability in fruits (52.3 +/- 22.3%) than vegetables (22.1 +/- 5.6%) (p < or = 0.001).
Conclusion: A major portion (47.8%) of the variance in calcium availability, as determined by multiple regression, could be explained by protein (p = 0.058, beta = -0.691). Major predictors of iron availability among the nutrients were iron content of the meal (p = 0.014, beta = -0.838), carbohydrates (p = 0.044, beta = -0.610) and dietary fibre (p = 0.235, beta = -0.285). Zinc availability was merely influenced by the protein (p = 0.010, beta = -0.876) and fat content of the meals (p = 0.295, beta = 0.255) in relation to other nutrients.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of density, duration and the use of additives to the water during the transportation of juvenile tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and use of this data to establish a safe transportation protocol for the species. The tested products and dosages were: salt (1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/L), gypsum (100, 300 and 500 mg/L) and benzocaine (10, 20 and 30 mg/L). Fish were transported in closed systems (plastic bag) at different densities and time periods of up to 24 h. Fish survival (FS) and water quality parameters were monitored immediately after transportation. The remaining fish were kept in floating cages in order to evaluate mortality which occurred up to 96 h after transportation (S96). The best fish density, additives dosages and time period of the transportation was estimated with a general linear model. The effect of the condition factor on FS and S96 was also evaluated. As expected, FS and S96 were significantly related to time and density. FS but not S96, were also were significantly related to treatment. FS with gypsum treatment was not different from controls and FS with table salt and benzocaine treatments were significantly reduced. The condition factor was not related to either FS or S96. FS was inversely correlated with carbon dioxide concentration. It was concluded that the additives did not improve fish transportation survival. Linear models were developed to predict the best transportation densities as a function of time.

Although dairy products have been found to be associated with an elevated risk of prostate cancer, studies investigating the potential effect of Ca are limited, and findings are inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to test the relationship between the risk of prostate cancer and consumption of dairy products and Ca. The analysis included 2776 men from the French SU.VI.MAX (Supplementation en Vitamines et Minéraux Antioxydants) prospective study, among whom sixty-nine developed prostate cancer during the follow-up period (median: 7.7 years). Food consumption was assessed at inclusion from repeated 24 h records and nutrient intake was calculated using a food composition table. A higher risk of prostate cancer was observed among subjects with higher dairy product (relative risk (RR; 95 % CI), 4th quartile v. 1st: 1.35 (1.02, 1.78), P = 0.04) and Ca intake (RR (95 % CI), 4th quartile v. 1st: 2.43 (1.05, 5.62), P = 0.04). Nevertheless, we identified a harmful effect of yoghurt consumption upon the risk of prostate cancer (RR (95 % CI), increment 125 g/d: 1.61 (1.07, 2.43), P = 0.02) independently of the Ca content. Our data support the hypothesis that dairy products have a harmful effect with respect to the risk of prostate cancer, largely related to Ca content. The higher risk of prostate cancer with linear increasing yoghurt consumption seems to be independent of Ca and may be related to some other component.
