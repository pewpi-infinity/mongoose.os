All-inorganic colloidal perovskite quantum dots (QDs) based on cesium, lead, and halide have recently emerged as promising light emitting materials. CsPbBr 3 QDs have also been demonstrated as stable two-photon-pumped lasing medium. However, the reported two photon absorption (TPA) cross sections for these QDs differ by an order of magnitude. Here we present an in-depth study of the TPA properties of CsPbBr 3 QDs with mean size ranging from 4.6 to 11.4 nm. By using femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy we found that TPA cross section is proportional to the linear one photon absorption. The TPA cross section follows a power law dependence on QDs size with exponent 3.3 ± 0.2. The empirically obtained power-law dependence suggests that the TPA process through a virtual state populates exciton band states. The revealed power-law dependence and the understanding of TPA process are important for developing high performance nonlinear optical devices based on CsPbBr 3 nanocrystals.

For Cs and Co gamma ray spectra, gamma ray energy is proportional to the amplitude of the pulse signal, and energy resolution can be improved by pulse signal processing with mathematical algorithms. Influenced by system measurement noise and baseline fluctuation, the pulse amplitude is difficult to calculate accurately. A method that combines the Kalman filter baseline estimation with the non-linear exponential fitting has been used. By this method, the pulse signal is divided into two parts: one is the raising edge before the pulse peak, and another is after the pulse peak. The pulse amplitude equals the difference between the pulse starting height and the pulse peak height. The pulse starting height is obtained by Kalman filter baseline estimation on the rising edge of the pulse starting point. The pulse peak height is calculated by nonlinear exponential fitting on the falling edge of the pulse highest point. When the sampling rate is 100 MHz, the pulse signals obtained from a Cd(Zn)Te detector are analyzed by this method. Results have shown that the processed pulses have a more distinguishable amplitude distribution; energy resolution for the Cs spectrum is approximately 2.97% at 662 keV (~19.66 keV FWHM), and for the Co spectrum it is 2.61% at 1,332 keV (~34.76 keV FWHM).
