The identities of 9 c, 9 d, 9 e, 11 a, and trans-[Ru{C≡CC 6 H 4 -4-(E)-CHCHC 6 H 4 -4-tBu} 2 (dppe) 2 ] (12 and 12') were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The electrochemical properties of 9 a-e, 11 a-b, 14 a-c, 15 a-c, 16 b, 17 a, 17 b, and 18 were assessed by cyclic voltammetry; the studies reveal that potentials for the fully/quasi-reversible metal-centered oxidation processes decrease upon introduction of solubilizing alkyl substituents and increase upon increasing acceptor substituent strength; other structural variations have little impact. UV/Vis-NIR spectroscopic studies on these complexes reveal lowest-energy metal-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands that redshift upon increasing the acceptor substituent strength, blueshift on alkyl incorporation, and gain in intensity on progression from linear to star complexes. Low-temperature UV/Vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical studies of 14 a-c show the appearance of an intense low-energy band at 7400-7900 cm -1 that is redshifted upon π-system lengthening and alkyl substituent incorporation. The cubic nonlinear optical properties of 9 d, 9 e, 14 a-c, 15 a-c, 16 b, 17 a, b, and 18 were assayed by femtosecond Z-scan studies at benchmark wavelengths (750 and 800 nm) in the near-IR region, with nonlinearity increasing upon nitro incorporation; the values for the E-ene-linked dendrimers in these studies are much larger than yne-linked analogues. Compounds 9 d, 9 e, 14 a-c, and 18 were further examined by broad-spectral-range femtosecond Z-scan studies; the cruciform complexes have appreciable multiphoton absorption cross-sections, with maximal values close to two and three times the wavelength of the linear optical absorption maxima.

The successful synthesis of ruthenium oxide/reduced graphene oxide (RuO 2 /rGO) heterostructures by one-pot hydrothermal method using graphene oxides and RuCl 3 as precursors is reported. The heterostructures had high peroxidase-like (POD-like) activities, which catalyzes the oxidation of classical peroxidase substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in the presence of H 2 O 2 to create a blue colored reaction product. The catalytic activity was significantly enhanced by the synergistic effect between RuO 2 nanoparticles and rGO. RuO 2 /rGO had a low K m of 0.068 mM and a high v max of 1.228 × 10 -7 M·s -1 towards TMB in the TMB-H 2 O 2 catalytic oxidation system. In addition, the POD-like activity originating from the electron transfer mechanism was confirmed by cytochrome C (Cyt C) oxidation experiment. A colorimetric method based on RuO 2 /rGO heterostructures was developed with good sensitivity and selectivity for glucose detection with a limit of detection of 3.34 μM and a linear range of 0-1500 μM. The RuO 2 /rGO heterostructures have potential applications in the biomedical areas, such as biosensor and diagnostics.

A novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for hyaluronidase (HAase) based on the adjustable electrostatic interaction between the surface-charge-controllable nanoparticles and negatively charged electrode has been devised. Hyaluronic acid (HA)-coated amino-modified ruthenium bipyridine-doped silica nanoparticles (Ru@SiO 2 -NH 2 @HA NPs) have been synthesized and act as ECL indicators, and the surface of this particle is negatively charged because HA contains a large amount of OH- and COO-. The strong electrostatic repulsion between the Ru@SiO 2 -NH 2 @HA NPs and negatively charged indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surface leads to the detection of a low-intensity ECL signal. In the presence of HAase, the HA on the surface of the Ru@SiO 2 -NH 2 @HA NPs can be decomposed, and the particles can be transformed into positively charged amino-modified ruthenium bipyridine-doped silica nanoparticles (Ru@SiO 2 -NH 2 NPs), which can be concentrated near the surface of the ITO electrode through electrostatic attraction, and result in the detection of an enhanced ECL signal. The ECL of the system has a good linear relationship with HAase concentration in the range of 2.0-60 U/mL, and the limit of detection was 0.37 U/mL. The designed biosensor had been applied to detect the target in real samples with satisfied results.

Multiple signal strategies remarkably improve the accuracy and efficiency of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassays, but the lack of potential-resolved luminophore pairs and chemical cross talk hinders their development. In this study, we synthesized a series of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/reduced graphene oxide (Au/rGO) composites as adjustable oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalysts to promote and modulate tris(2,2'-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy) 3 2+ )'s multisignal luminescence. With the increase in the diameter of AuNPs (3 to 30 nm), their ability to promote Ru(bpy) 3 2+ 's anodic ECL was first impaired and then strengthened, and cathodic ECL was first enhanced and then weakened. Au/rGOs with medium-small and medium-large AuNP diameters remarkably increased Ru(bpy) 3 2+ 's cathodic and anodic luminescence, respectively. Notably, the stimulation effects of Au/rGOs were superior to those of most existing Ru(bpy) 3 2+ co-reactants. Moreover, we proposed a novel ratiometric immunosensor construction strategy using Ru(bpy) 3 2+ 's luminescence promoter rather than luminophores as tags of antibodies to achieve signal resolution. This method avoids signal cross talk between luminophores and their respective co-reactants, which achieved a good linear range of 10 -7 to 10 -1 ng/ml and a limit of detection of 0.33 fg/ml for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen. This study addresses the previous scarcity of the macromolecular co-reactants of Ru(bpy) 3 2+ , broadening its application in biomaterial detection. Furthermore, the systematic clarification of the detailed mechanisms for converting the potential-resolved luminescence of Ru(bpy) 3 2+ could facilitate an in-depth understanding of the ECL process and should inspire new designs of Ru(bpy) 3 2+ luminescence enhancers or applications of Au/rGOs to other luminophores. This work removes some impediments to the development of multisignal ECL biodetection systems and provides vitality into their widespread applications.

Monitoring of protein kinase activity is of significance for fundamentals of biochemistry, biomedical diagnose, and drug screening. To reduce the usage of a relatively complicated bio-labeled signal probe, the phosphate group-derivated bipyridine-ruthenium (Pbpy-Ru) complex and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) were employed as signal probes to develop an electrochemical sensor for evaluating the protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Through the specific interaction between the phosphate groups and TiO 2 NPs, the preparation of a Pbpy-Ru-TiO 2 NP signal probe and its linkage with the phosphorylated PKA substrate peptides could be performed in a simple and effective way. The tethering of Pbpy-Ru onto the TiO 2 NP surface does not degrade the electrochemical property of the complex. The Pbpy-Ru-TiO 2 NP probe exhibits well-defined redox signals at about 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl reference and notably has about fivefold current response than that of the TiO 2 NPs with physically adsorbed tris-(bipyridine)-Ru. The PKA activity evaluation was realized by measuring the electrochemical response of the Pbpy-Ru-TiO 2 NPs at the phosphorylated peptide-assembled electrode. Operating at optimal conditions, the cathodic signals at the potential of 1.03 V exhibit a good linearity with the PKA concentrations of 0.5-40 U mL -1 . The electrochemical sensor shows good selectivity, low detection limit (0.2 U mL -1 , signal/noise = 3), qualified reproducibility, and satisfactory applicability for PKA determination in the cell lysate. The Pbpy-Ru-TiO 2 NPs/electrode system would be an excellent electrochemical platform for protein phosphorylation monitoring and sensing.

In this work, combined with the high amplification efficiency of hybridization chain reaction (HCR), high specificity of the CRISPR/Cas12a system, and convenience of the homogeneous electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay based on the regulation of negative charge on the reporting probes, a sensitive ECL biosensor for hepatitis B virus DNA (chosen as a model target) had been developed. The initiator chain trigger DNA that can induce HCR amplification is modified on the surface of ruthenium bipyridine-doped silica nanoparticles (Ru@SiO 2 NPs) first, and large amounts of negative charges modified on the particles were achieved through the HCR amplification reaction. The efficiency of the nanoparticles reaching the negatively charged working electrode can be regulated and realize the change of the ECL signal. In addition, long DNA on the surface of the luminescent body may prevent the coreactant from entering the pore to react with ruthenium bipyridine. These factors combine to produce a low-background system. The presence of the target can activate the CRISPR/Cas12a system and make trigger DNA disappear from the nanoparticle surface, and strong ECL can be detected. The sensor does not require a complex electrode modification; therefore, it has better reproducibility. Additionally, due to dual signal amplification, the sensor has a high sensitivity. In the range of 10 fM to 10 nM, the ECL intensity exhibits a strong linear relationship with the logarithm of the target concentration, and the detection limit is 7.41 fM. This sensor has shown high accuracy in detecting clinical samples, which holds significant potential for application in clinical testing.

A sensitive and selective photoluminescent sensor based on the highly charged monoruthenium(II) complex was designed to detect dopamine (DA) in aqueous samples. Two novel highly charged cationic ruthenium(II) complexes [Ru(bpy) 2 (bpy-N)]X 4 (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, bpy-N = 4,4'-bis[N,N,N-triethyl-(methylamino)]-2,2'-bipyridine, X - = [PF 6 ] - (1a) or Cl - (1b) and [Ru(bpy)(bpy-N) 2 ]X 6 (X - = [PF 6 ] - (2a) or Cl - (2b)) can be assembled with anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS), leading to an enhancement of photoluminescence intensity. Upon addition of DA to the system, the photoluminescence intensity of the assembled system was quenched due to the energy transfer effect. It exhibited a wide linear range (0.1-50 μM) and low detection limit (10 nM). The sensor demonstrated a high selectivity toward DA, especially in the presence of adrenaline (Adr) and norepinephrine (NE), whose structures are similar to DA in biological systems. With the merits of simple operation, obvious phenomenon and fast response speed, the sensor had a potential application prospect in human urine sample.

A novel solid-state electrochemiluminesence (ECL) "on-off" switch system for highly sensitive detection of tryptophan based on the luminescence-functionalized ruthenium metal-organic framework (Ru-MOF) nanoflowers and CdS quantum dots (CdSQDs) was described. Ru-MOF nanoflowers were prepared by a one-step solvothermal method at low temperature and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and fluorescence (FL) spectra. For potential applications, the Ru-MOF nanoflowers were used to fabricate an ECL "on-off" switch sensor with CdSQDs for the detection of tryptophan enantiomers by quenching effect. Meanwhile the functionalized fullerene nanoparticles were used to enhance signal intensity. Furthermore, the stepwise modified process was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The proposed ECL sensor had a wide linear range from 1.0 nM to 1.0mM with a lower detection limit of 0.33nM for tryptophan enantiomers. This method was simple to prepare, fast to operate, with good sensitivity and excellent stability for the development of efficient and practical ECL sensors.

Tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II)-based luminophores have been well developed in the area of electrochemiluminescence, while their applications in chemiluminescence (CL) are rarely studied due to the poor luminous efficiency and complicated CL reaction. Herein, a novel tris(bipyridine) ruthenium(II)-based ternary CL system is proposed by introducing cobalt single atoms integrated with graphene-encapsulated cobalt nanoparticles (Co SAs/Co@C) and peroxymonosulfate (PMS) as advanced coreaction accelerator and promising coreactant, respectively. On the basis of the experimental results and density functional theory calculations, it is concluded that Co@C can synergistically modulate the adsorption behavior of PMS on Co SAs and then efficiently activate PMS to produce massive singlet oxygen for remarkable CL emission. Under the optimum conditions, the as-prepared CL biosensor exhibits a good linear range, excellent sensitivity, and selectivity, holding great potential for the practical detection of prostate-specific antigen in human serum.

In this contribution, a simple and sensitive fluorescent sensor for the determination of both the three ruthenium anticancer drugs (1 to 3) and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was established based on the CdTe quantum dots (QDs) fluorescence "OFF-ON" mode. Under the experimental conditions, the fluorescence of CdTe QDs can be effectively quenched by ruthenium anticancer drugs because of the surface binding of these drugs on CdTe QDs and the subsequent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process from CdTe QDs to ruthenium anticancer drugs, which render the system into fluorescence "OFF" status. The system can then be "ON" after the addition of ctDNA which brought the restoration of CdTe QDs fluorescence intensity, since ruthenium anticancer drugs broke away from the surface of CdTe QDs and inserted into double helix structure of ctDNA. The fluorescence quenching effect of the CdTe QDs-ruthenium anticancer drugs systems was mainly concentration dependent, which could be used to detect three ruthenium anticancer drugs. The limits of detection were 5.5 × 10(-8) M for ruthenium anticancer drug 1, 7.0 × 10(-8) M for ruthenium anticancer drug 2, and 7.9× 10(-8) M for ruthenium anticancer drug 3, respectively. The relative restored fluorescence intensity was directly proportional to the concentration of ctDNA in the range of 1.0 × 10(-8) M ∼ 3.0 × 10(-7) M, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.9983 and a limit of detection of 1.1 × 10(-9) M. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 1.5 × 10(-7) M ctDNA was 1.5% (n = 5). There was almost no interference to some common chemical compounds, nucleotides, amino acids, and proteins. The proposed method was applied to the determination of ctDNA in three synthetic samples with satisfactory results. The possible reaction mechanism of CdTe QDs fluorescence "OFF-ON" was further investigated. This simple and sensitive approach possessed some potential applications in the investigation of interaction between drug molecules and DNA.
