The three widely used isotherms Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin were examined in an experiment using fluoride (F⁻) ion adsorption on a geo-material (limonite) at four different temperatures by linear and non-linear models. Comparison of linear and non-linear regression models were given in selecting the optimum isotherm for the experimental results. The coefficient of determination, r², was used to select the best theoretical isotherm. The four Langmuir linear equations (1, 2, 3, and 4) are discussed. Langmuir isotherm parameters obtained from the four Langmuir linear equations using the linear model differed but they were the same when using the nonlinear model. Langmuir-2 isotherm is one of the linear forms, and it had the highest coefficient of determination (r² = 0.99) compared to the other Langmuir linear equations (1, 3 and 4) in linear form, whereas, for non-linear, Langmuir-4 fitted best among all the isotherms because it had the highest coefficient of determination (r² = 0.99). The results showed that the non-linear model may be a better way to obtain the parameters. In the present work, the thermodynamic parameters show that the absorption of fluoride onto limonite is both spontaneous (ΔG < 0) and endothermic (ΔH > 0). Scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction images also confirm the adsorption of F⁻ ion onto limonite. The isotherm and kinetic study reveals that limonite can be used as an adsorbent for fluoride removal. In future we can develop new technology for fluoride removal in large scale by using limonite which is cost-effective, eco-friendly and is easily available in the study area.

In a RASER (Radio-frequency Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation), the fast relaxing electromagnetic modes of an LC resonator are enslaved by the slow nuclear spin motion, whose coherence decays with the transverse relaxation rate γ m =1/T 2 ∗ . Such a system obeys the slaving principle, mathematically identical with the adiabatic elimination procedure, leading to multi-mode RASER equations. If the pumping rate of nuclear spin polarization Γ>>γ m , a second adiabatic elimination process applies and the spectral properties of the RASER can be predicted. The resulting model is similar to the model of two non-linear coupled oscillators and predicts the observed RASER phenomena, including frequency combs and mode collapse. If the second adiabatic elimination is not applicable, mode collapse is completely absent and successive period doubling processes and chaos occur at very high population inversions. We compare these theoretical predictions with experimental results from a PHIP (Para-Hydrogen Induced Polarization) pumped 1 H RASER. Moreover, in SABRE (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange) pumped 1 H experiments, RASER revivals are observed long after the parahydrogen pumping source has been switched off. All these findings shed light onto the links between NMR spectroscopy, RASER physics, synergetics and chaos theory. Several new applications are envisioned in the fields of quantum sensor technology, structure investigation or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Pyrazinamide (PZA) is a key drug in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although not completely understood yet, the bactericidal mechanism of PZA starts with its diffusion into the cell and subsequent conversion into pyrazinoic acid (POA) after the hydrolysis of ammonia group. This leads to the acidification cycle, which involves: (1) POA extrusion into the extracellular environment, (2) reentry of protonated POA, and (3) release of a proton into the cytoplasm, resulting in acidification of the cytoplasm and accumulation of intracellular POA. To better understand this process, we developed a system of coupled non-linear differential equations, which successfully recapitulates the kinetics of PZA/POA observed in M. tuberculosis. The parametric space was explored, assessing the impact of different PZA and pH concentrations and variations in the kinetic parameters, finding scenarios of PZA susceptibility and resistance. Furthermore, our predictions show that the acidification cycle alone is not enough to result in significant intracellular accumulation of POA in experimental time scales when compared to other neutral pH scenarios. Thus, revealing the need of novel hypotheses and experimental evidence to determine the missing mechanisms that may explain the pH-dependent intracellular accumulation of POA and their subsequent effects.

Pneumatochemical impedance spectroscopy (PIS) is the indirect transposition of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to solid-gas reactions. In PIS analysis, an analogy is made between pressure and electrical potential on one hand and gas flow and electric current on the other hand, and pneumatochemical transfer functions are derived from gas-phase measurements. Potentially, this spectroscopy can be used to analyze the dynamics of any solid-gas system including adsorption (surface) and absorption (bulk) phenomena, gas (H2) permeation across metallic membranes, and electrocatalysis in gaseous fuel cells. Hydrogen absorption by intermetallic compounds (IMCs), a process of great practical interest for hydrogen storage applications, is more specifically considered in this paper, and the kinetic equations derived in this work pertain only to this case. Whereas classical electrochemical impedance measurements are performed using an harmonic analyzer and monochromatic potential (potentiostatic mode) or current (intentiostatic mode) perturbations, PIS investigation of the dynamics of IMC-H2(g) systems is more conveniently performed using Sievert's-type gas distribution apparatus (SGDA) and polychromatic pressure perturbation signals. This is first because monochromatic isothermal pressure modulations cannot be easily obtained experimentally over the frequency domain of interest and, second, because most IMC-H2(g) systems exhibit strongly nonlinear behaviors in two-phase domains (hysteresis), and this proscribes harmonic analysis. A further benefit of using SGDA and nonharmonic perturbations is that kinetic and thermodynamic information are collected simultaneously during the same experiment. The measurement and modeling of the pneumatochemical transfer functions associated with IMC-H2(g) systems, both in solid solution and two-phase domains, are discussed in this paper which is organized in two parts. The principles of PIS analysis, based on the theory of linear and time-invariant systems, are presented in the first part. The dynamics of hydrogen sorption by metals and IMCs is analyzed in the second part, where a detailed analysis of the multistep reaction paths involved in sorption mechanisms is proposed.

This Review integrates the use of electronic optical response function theory and the mixed quantum-classical (MQC) Liouville equation (MQCLE), thereby leading to electronic spectroscopy in MQC media. It further sheds light on the applicability, utility, and efficiency of the mixed quantum-classical dynamics (MQCD) formalism, which starts off with the MQCLE, in probing spectroscopy and dynamics of condensed systems, whereby quantum mechanics and classical mechanics are combined systematically. The author has been exploring and implementing MQCD to investigate electron-phonon coupling effects on electronic dephasing in harmonic and anharmonic systems by calculating linear and nonlinear optical transition analytically and numerically dipole moment time correlation functions in an MQC environment, thereby presenting an in depth spectral profile analysis and their shape and symmetry. The distinctive capability of the MQC time correlation functions is that ergodicity and stationarity properties are inherently satisfied as part of the mixed quantum-classical dynamics (MQCD) framework, unlike classical correlation functions. While some research groups have applied MQCLE to calculate vibrational spectra to study hydrogen-bonded complexes in a MQC environment and other groups calculated Optical response function to probe electron transfer dynamics using the basis mapping technique, the approach, purpose, rigor, applications, and path to the end results reported herein are different. Finally, the same framework is employed to study dissipative systems in the MQC limit, whereby the zero-phonon line adopts the correct width and eliminates its asymmetry. While the full quantum mechanical model, like the multimode Brownian oscillator (MBO) model, yields the correct width and inaccurate shape in the low-temperature limit, the MQCD formalism seems to produce an accurate zero-phonon profile. Nonlinear optical signals are also reviewed in MQC media to show the applicability and utility of this approach. The vibronic optical response functions developed here will account for geometry change, frequency change, and anharmonicity upon electronic excitation to accurately probe electronic dephasing, electron-phonon coupling, shape, and symmetry of profiles and present differences and similarities to the MBO model on pure electronic dephasing. Frequency change and anharmonicity are vitally crucial for accurately assessing electron-phonon coupling upon electronic excitation. This is an additional unique result obtained by the author to further demonstrate the applicability and utility of this approach over other approximation schemes in probing electronic dephasing including that of the MBO model.

Formamide (FA) exhibits complete miscibility with water, offering a simplified model for exploring the solvation dynamics of peptide linkages in biophysical processes. Its liquid state demonstrates a three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network akin to water, reflecting solvent-like behavior. Analyzing the microscopic structure and dynamics of FA-water mixtures is expected to provide crucial insights into hydrogen bonding dynamics─a key aspect of various biophysical phenomena. This study is focused on the dynamics of FA-water mixtures using linear and femtosecond infrared spectroscopies. By using the intrinsic OD stretch and extrinsic probe SCN - , the local vibrational behaviors across various FA-water compositions were systematically investigated. The vibrational relaxation of OD stretch revealed a negligible impact of FA addition on the vibrational lifetime of water molecules, underscoring the mixture's water-like behavior. However, the reorientational dynamics of OD stretch slowed with increasing FA mole fraction ( X FA ), plateauing beyond X FA > 0.5. This suggests a correlation between OD's reorientational time and the strength of the hydrogen bond network, likely tied to the solution's changing dielectric constant. Conversely, the vibrational relaxation dynamics of SCN - was strongly correlated with X FA , highlighting a competition between water and FA molecules in solvating SCN - . Moreover, a linear relationship between rising viscosity and the prolonged correlation time of SCN - 's slow dynamics indicates that the solution's macroscopic viscosity is dictated by the extended structures formed between FA and water molecules. The relation between the reorientation dynamics of the SCN - and the macroscopic viscosity in aqueous FA-water mixture solutions was analyzed by using the Stokes-Einstein-Debye equations. The direct viscosity-diffusion coupling is observed, which can be attributed to the homogeneous dynamics feature in FA-water mixture solutions. The inclusion of these intrinsic and extrinsic probes not only enhances the comprehensiveness of our analysis but also provides valuable insights into various aspects of the dynamics within the FA-water system. This investigation sheds light on the fundamental dynamics of FA-water mixtures, emphasizing their molecular-level homogeneity in this binary mixture solution.

Protein-phenolic compound interactions are commonly investigated with inappropriate linear equations for the analysis of binding strength and stoichiometry. This work utilises more appropriate protocols for the investigation of molecular interactions between vanillic acid and β-lactoglobulin at pH 2.4, where the protein predominately exists as a monomer. Non-linear binding and Job plot analysis were conducted on fluorescence data to effectively determine the interaction's dissociation constant (K D , 2.93 × 10 -5 M) and stoichiometry (1:1). Furthermore, spectroscopic techniques revealed statistically significant alterations to the conformational characteristics of β-lactoglobulin upon complexation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support a 1:1 interaction stoichiometry and reveal that the stabilisation of vanillic acid was dynamic in nature but mainly supported by four π-alkyl interactions and one hydrogen bond, located within the β-barrel of the monomer. Water molecules, which are generally not accounted for in MD simulation analysis, were shown to be an important factor in the ligand stabilization via bridging interactions.

A dinuclear Nd(III) complex was synthesized and characterized via single-crystal X-ray diffraction and magnetic measurements. The crystal structure of [{Nd 2 (bbpen) 2 (H 2 O) 2 }Cl 2 ] reveals the presence of symmetrically similar but crystallographically different two Nd(III) ions. In the dinuclear unit, phenoxide-bridged Nd(III) ions remain in distorted square antiprismatic (SAP) geometry. The anti-orientation of coordinated H 2 O makes intra-molecular hydrogen bonding with the axial phenoxide moiety. The presence of two external Cl - ions neutralized the charge of the dimeric unit. The AC magnetic properties of the complex showed field-induced single-molecule magnetic behavior. The dynamic magnetic relaxation was fitted using linear as well as nonlinear equations. The high-temperature linear fitting gives a thermal energy barrier of about 32 K, whereas fitting the entire temperature range with Orbach and quantum tunnelling of magnetization (QTM) relaxation processes provides a phenomenological energy barrier of 37 K. The energy barrier (U eff ) of this Nd(III) complex is not only the highest for dinuclear Nd(III) single-molecule magnets (SMMs) but also one of the highest for polynuclear Nd(III)-based SMMs to date. The ab initio calculation further corroborated the experimentally obtained magnetization dynamics.

The present research investigates the double-chain deoxyribonucleic acid model, which is important for the transfer and retention of genetic material in biological domains. This model is composed of two lengthy uniformly elastic filaments, that stand in for a pair of polynucleotide chains of the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule joined by hydrogen bonds among the bottom combination, demonstrating the hydrogen bonds formed within the chain's base pairs. The modified extended Fan sub equation method effectively used to explain the exact travelling wave solutions for the double-chain deoxyribonucleic acid model. Compared to the earlier, now in use methods, the previously described modified extended Fan sub equation method provide more innovative, comprehensive solutions and are relatively straightforward to implement. This method transforms a non-linear partial differential equation into an ODE by using a travelling wave transformation. Additionally, the study yields both single and mixed non-degenerate Jacobi elliptic function type solutions. The complexiton, kink wave, dark or anti-bell, V, anti-Z and singular wave shapes soliton solutions are a few of the creative solutions that have been constructed utilizing modified extended Fan sub equation method that can offer details on the transversal and longitudinal moves inside the DNA helix by freely chosen parameters. Solitons propagate at a consistent rate and retain their original shape. They are widely used in nonlinear models and can be found everywhere in nature. To help in understanding the physical significance of the double-chain deoxyribonucleic acid model, several solutions are shown with graphics in the form of contour, 2D and 3D graphs using computer software Mathematica 13.2. All of the requisite constraint factors that are required for the completed solutions to exist appear to be met. Therefore, our method of strengthening symbolic computations offers a powerful and effective mathematical tool for resolving various moderate nonlinear wave problems. The findings demonstrate the system's potentially very rich precise wave forms with biological significance. The fundamentals of double-chain deoxyribonucleic acid model diffusion and processing are demonstrated by this work, which marks a substantial development in our knowledge of double-chain deoxyribonucleic acid model movements.

The dissociation state of phosphatidic acid (PA) in a lipid bilayer is governed by the competition of proton binding and formation of a hydrogen bond through a mechanism termed the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch. This mechanism has been suggested to provide the basis for the specific recognition of PA by proteins. Even in bare lipid bilayers the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch is present if the membrane contains lipids like phosphatidylethanolamine that act as hydrogen bond donors. In this case, the dissociation state (pK(a)) of PA depends strongly on membrane composition. In the present work we incorporate the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch mechanism into the Gouy-Chapman model for a membrane that is composed of PA and a hydrogen bond-donating zwitterionic lipid. To this end, our model integrates into the Gouy-Chapman approach a recently suggested electrostatic model for zwitterionic lipids. Hydrogen bond formation is incorporated phenomenologically as an additional non-electrostatic interaction between the phosphomonoester headgroup of PA and the zwitterionic lipid headgroup. We express the energetics of the composite membrane in terms of a free energy functional whose minimization leads to a modified non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation that we have solved numerically. Our calculations focus on the influence of the membrane environment on the dissociation state of PA. This influence can be expressed as a shift of the second pK(a) of PA, which we calculate as function of membrane composition, following experimental observation. The shift is large and negative if PA is the minor component in the membrane, and it changes over four pH units as function of the mole fraction of PA in the membrane. In contrast, the shift of the second pK(a) of PA remains small and is always positive if the zwitterionic lipid is unable to act as hydrogen bond donor. Hence, we find that the electrostatic-hydrogen bond switch mechanism regulates the dissociation state of PA with much greater sensitivity than would be possible based on a pure electrostatic regulation through the membrane potential.
