RNA pseudoknots are a kind of minimal RNA tertiary structural motifs, and their three-dimensional (3D) structures and stability play essential roles in a variety of biological functions. Therefore, to predict 3D structures and stability of RNA pseudoknots is essential for understanding their functions. In the work, we employed our previously developed coarse-grained model with implicit salt to make extensive predictions and comprehensive analyses on the 3D structures and stability for RNA pseudoknots in monovalent/divalent ion solutions. The comparisons with available experimental data show that our model can successfully predict the 3D structures of RNA pseudoknots from their sequences, and can also make reliable predictions for the stability of RNA pseudoknots with different lengths and sequences over a wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations. Furthermore, we made comprehensive analyses on the unfolding pathway for various RNA pseudoknots in ion solutions. Our analyses for extensive pseudokonts and the wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations verify that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots is mainly dependent on the relative stability of unfolded intermediate states, and show that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots can be significantly modulated by their sequences and solution ion conditions.

Background and objective: As for repairing the perforated tympanic membranes (TM), temporalis fascia and tragal cartilage are popular in clinics as autologous graft materials. However, there is a significant hearing loss after repairing the TM with autologous graft materials, which needs to be addressed in biomechanical engineering.
Methods: The finite element model of normal middle ear is improved from two aspects: the repair method of tympanic fibrous layer and the bionic spider web tympanic scaffold. By creating the solid-shell coupling condition and strong coupling boundary condition to simulate the repair, TM umbo and stapes footplate displacement-frequency response are explored in 200-8000 Hz.
