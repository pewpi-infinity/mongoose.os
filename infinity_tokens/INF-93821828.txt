  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: ionic cascade, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: field rebound, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: ionic cascade, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: quantum bleed, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: harmonic rise, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: substrate gain, harmonic split.
