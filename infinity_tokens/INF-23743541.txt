INF vectorize: electron spin alignment across a quasi-1D conductor.
Substrate: doped semiconductor ribbon under variable bias.
Order: approximately linear at low field; nonlinear beyond threshold.

Use-Case:
  This record represents one run of the Infinity Research Reactor.
  Parameters above can be replayed inside Infinity OS to reconstruct
  the simulated experiment for Octave/quantum route planning.
