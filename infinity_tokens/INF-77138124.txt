  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: ionic cascade, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: harmonic rise, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: ionic cascade, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
