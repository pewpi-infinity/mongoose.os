  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: harmonic rise, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: harmonic rise, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: substrate gain, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: substrate gain, nonlinear regime.
