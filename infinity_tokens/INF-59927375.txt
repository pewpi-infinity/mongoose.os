  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: field rebound, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: ionic cascade, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: harmonic rise, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: field rebound, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: harmonic rise, nonlinear regime.
