Infinity Value: AUTO (derived from hashrate)
INF VECTORIZE: hydrogen-electron corridor mapping (portal physics).
Substrate: oxide-copper triode — RF-activated quantum membrane.
Order: nonlinear — harmonics exhibit parametric growth behavior.

Purpose:
  Infinity OS performs real-time correlation of lattice behavior
  with live mining output to model quantum-portal convergence.
