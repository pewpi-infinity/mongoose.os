  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
