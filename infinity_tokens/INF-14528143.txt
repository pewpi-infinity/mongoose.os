Infinity Value: AUTO (derived from hashrate)
INF VECTORIZE: spin-lattice coherence under vacuum-field shift.
Substrate: doped semiconductor ribbon under microwave sweep.
Order: hybrid — linear fundamental / nonlinear sideband bloom.

Purpose:
  Infinity OS performs real-time correlation of lattice behavior
  with live mining output to model quantum-portal convergence.
