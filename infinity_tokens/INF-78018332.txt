  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: vector drift, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: harmonic rise, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: quantum bleed, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: substrate gain, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: field rebound, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: quantum bleed, pre-coherence bloom.
