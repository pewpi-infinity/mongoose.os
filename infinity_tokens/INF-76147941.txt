  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: harmonic rise, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
