  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: harmonic rise, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: field rebound, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: ionic cascade, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: field rebound, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: substrate gain, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: ionic cascade, pre-coherence bloom.
