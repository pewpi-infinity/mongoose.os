  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: field rebound, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: harmonic rise, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: quantum bleed, nonlinear regime.
