  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: harmonic rise, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: harmonic rise, pre-coherence bloom.
