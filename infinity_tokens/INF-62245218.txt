  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: quantum bleed, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: quantum bleed, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: field rebound, nonlinear regime.
