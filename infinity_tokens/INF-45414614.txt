  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: substrate gain, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: harmonic rise, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: quantum bleed, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: quantum bleed, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 8: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
