INF vectorize: hydrogen-portal resonance mapping in a disordered lattice.
Substrate: oxide film on copper, subjected to RF excitation.
Order: nonlinear — emergent harmonics observed above driving frequency.

Use-Case:
  This record represents one run of the Infinity Research Reactor.
  Parameters above can be replayed inside Infinity OS to reconstruct
  the simulated experiment for Octave/quantum route planning.
