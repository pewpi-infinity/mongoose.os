  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: substrate gain, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: ionic cascade, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: ionic cascade, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: harmonic rise, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
