  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: field rebound, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: quantum bleed, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: substrate gain, thermal flattening.
