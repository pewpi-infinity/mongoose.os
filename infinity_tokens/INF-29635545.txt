  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: vector drift, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: harmonic rise, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: field rebound, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: vector drift, harmonic split.
