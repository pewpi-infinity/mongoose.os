  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: harmonic rise, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: field rebound, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: quantum bleed, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: ionic cascade, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 8: vector drift, harmonic split.
