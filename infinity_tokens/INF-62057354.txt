  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: field rebound, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: ionic cascade, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
