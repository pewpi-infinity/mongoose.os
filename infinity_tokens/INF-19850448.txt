  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: quantum bleed, phase cascade.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: harmonic rise, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: vector drift, carrier bloom.
