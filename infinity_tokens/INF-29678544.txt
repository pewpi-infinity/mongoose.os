  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: vector drift, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: harmonic rise, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: substrate gain, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: field rebound, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: harmonic rise, harmonic split.
