  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 1: substrate gain, carrier bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 2: harmonic rise, harmonic split.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 3: substrate gain, pre-coherence bloom.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 4: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 5: vector drift, thermal flattening.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 6: vector drift, nonlinear regime.
  • oxide-semiconductor resonance — phase 7: substrate gain, harmonic split.
