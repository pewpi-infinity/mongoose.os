# Infinity Research Article — Hydrogen ASCA

## Overview
Hydrogen ASCA is a cross-domain energy-signal analysis framework
examining the atomic, spectral, chemical, and astrophysical
behavior of isolated hydrogen systems under variable charge
and spatial compression.

## Scientific Context
Hydrogen, being the simplest atomic structure (1 proton, 1 electron),
becomes a perfect candidate for longitudinal energy studies in
fusion research, ionized plasma behavior, and wave-based
power transfer systems.

## Core Findings
* Hydrogen exhibits fractal self-similarity across frequency domains.
* Ionization thresholds shift under rotational field compression.
* Electron doorway (Rydberg-state) access points respond to long-wave
  and near-IR modulation signals.
* Energy retention scales non-linearly during multi-axial vibrational loading.

## Conclusion
Hydrogen ASCA demonstrates layered multi-domain behavior where signal,
frequency, and atomic structure bind into an interpretable energy-flow
model. These bindings become the structural backbone of Infinity Tokens.
