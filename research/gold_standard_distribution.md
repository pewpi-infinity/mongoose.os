# Gold Standard Distribution

## The Hierarchy

| Standard | Role | Color |
|----------|------|-------|
| **GOLD** | Current operating standard | #FFD700 |
| **PLATINUM** | Legacy foundation (Mario 1) | #E5E7EB |

## Core Principles

1. **Daily Allowance**: 48 tokens/day per user
2. **Unit Value**: $1.00 backed by Infinity Research + C13B0 Architecture
3. **Distribution**: 100% Peer-to-Peer — no hoarding
4. **Backing**: Recovered entropy compressed through 4-Hash system

## The Mario 1 vs Mario 2 Logic

- **Mario 1 (Platinum)**: Original repo versions — the foundation. B55 Gravity Engine,
  original machines, first-generation tools. Archived but accessible.
- **Mario 2 (Gold)**: Current-generation repos minted under Gold Standard.
  Every new repo improves on its Platinum ancestor.

## 4-Hash Master Compression

The system compresses raw entropy through four hash stages:
1. **Ingestion** — Raw data enters the pipeline
2. **Signal Winding** — Data is wound through transformer architecture
3. **Rectification** — Pure signal extracted, noise eliminated
4. **Gold Mint** — Final asset stamped with #FFD700 Gold Standard

## Implementation

- `gold_standard.json` — Ledger deployed to `infinity-crown-index/api/`
- `quanta-operator.js` — State navigator deployed to `infinity-crown-index/js/`
- All new repos minted with Gold badge
- Platinum repos archived as foundation layer
