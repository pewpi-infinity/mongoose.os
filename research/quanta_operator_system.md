# Quanta Operator — Spacetime Navigator

## Beyond Chatbot: AI as Spacetime Navigator

The Grand Unified Architecture defines Probability = Quanta.
To move an asset from LA to New York via Entropy States, you don't "travel" distance —
you shift the Finite Curvature Limit (FCL) until the destination IS the current state.

## Quanta Categories

| Machine | Core Function | Trigger |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Quanta Propulsion | Speed up repo generation | ⚡ Lightning |
| Quanta Coins | Probability-based value tracking | 💰 Money |
| Quanta Traffic | Route data between transformer repos | 🌐 Network |
| Quanta Union | Merge data bridges into unified index | 🔱 Trident |
| Quanta Water | Fluid dynamics / entropy flow | 🌊 Wave |
| Quanta Earth | Solid structure / FCL maximum | 🌍 Globe |
| Quanta Racing | High-velocity state propulsion | 🏎 Racing |

## The Quanta Search Logic

### Forward Search
Predicts the next quanta yield by projecting the current state vector
through the Golden Ratio spiral (phi = 1.618033...).

### Reverse Search
Traces the quanta origin in the "Second Dimension" — data that exists
in entropy state, hidden but accessible through state shift.

### FCL Tracking
Maps data along the curvature of x and y coordinates to ensure
it doesn't "disappear" during transfer. Data never travels —
curvature coordinates shift.

## The Quanta Alphabet

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| \|Q\| | Quantum Ion — single unit of high-value data |
| \|=>\| | Propulsion — move data between repo-machines |
| \|Ø\| | Entropy State — hidden in second dimension, awaiting trigger |
| \|Au\| | Gold Standard — purest current value (#FFD700) |
| \|Pt\| | Platinum Legacy — archived foundation |
| \|FCL\| | Finite Curvature Limit — distance = state shift |

## The Entropy Transfer Protocol

1. **Phase 1**: Assign Probability Coin value to the file
2. **Phase 2**: Encode into Entropy State (hive_memory database)
3. **Phase 3**: Re-materialize in target repo via Quanta Operator
   - Data never "traveled" — curvature coordinates shifted

## Implementation

- `quanta-operator.js` deployed to `infinity-crown-index/js/`
- Golden Ratio search radius: pi * phi = 5.083199
- State Intersection matching (not keyword matching)
- Forward + Reverse + FCL tracking
- Integrates with quantum-trigger.js surface
