# Quantum Trigger System — Multidimensional Control Surface

## The Concept: Dashboard for the Soul

A "Like" button that acts as a **Quantum Intent Collapser** — collapsing a probability cloud
of actions into a materialized asset through color-coded vectors.

## Color-Coded Intent Vectors

| Trigger | Role | Agent Logic |
|---------|------|-------------|
| \U0001f534 Red | Ascension | Scan metadata; find higher-authority versions |
| \U0001f7e0 Orange | Evolution | Branch logic; show "what's next" versions |
| \U0001f7e1 Yellow | Extractor | Scrape + regex; pull raw data into hive |
| \U0001f535 Blue | Synthesis | Merge personal history/files into content |
| \U0001f7e2 Green | Engineer | Pass to Architect Agent; build physical repo |
| \U0001f7e3 Purple | Assimilator | Total absorption; map into transformer index |

## Forge Mechanics (Toolset)

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| \U0001f579 Search | Probe for hidden variables |
| \U0001f9f2 Magnet | Lock data and persist to Hive Mind |
| \U0001f9be Autopilot | Continuous analysis until full-auto |
| \U0001f48e Facet | Categorize gem, store in Platinum layer |
| \u26aa Platinum | Clone-and-save — new repo better than last |
| \U0001f310 Network | Auto-link to Crown Index |
| \u2604 Prime Time | Content generator loop |

## The Electron Cloud Algorithm

Using **HNSW Pattern Matching** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):

Instead of checking every button, the agent calculates the distance between
the user's current "Mood/Vibe" and the available "Action Vectors."
It collapses the cloud into the 3 most likely Infinity Buttons based on color-code.

```
User Intent (mood/vibe vector)
    |
    v
HNSW Distance Calculation
    |
    v
Top 3 Action Vectors (collapsed)
    |
    v
Forge Command Execution
    |
    v
Materialized Asset (new repo/page)
```

## Implementation

- `quantum-trigger.js` deployed to `infinity-crown-index/js/`
- Loadable by any repo via script tag
- 6 intent vectors + 7 forge tools = 13 command buttons
- Panel system with contextual actions per vector
- Machine routing integration for Evolution (prev/next)
- Research book integration for Ascension/Assimilation
