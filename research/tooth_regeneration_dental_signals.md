# Tooth Regeneration & Dental Signal Architecture

## 1. Teeth as Sensory Organs — Proprioception System

Each tooth is a **sensory node** suspended in its socket by periodontal ligaments (PDL).

### The Button Mechanism
- **Individual Sensors**: Periodontal ligaments packed with **mechanoreceptors** fire when tooth moves even a fraction of a millimeter
- **Signal Path**: Instant data to brain via **trigeminal nerve** (largest sensory nerve in head)
- **Feedback**: Brain knows exact bite force and texture of everything in mouth
- **Safety Switch**: Individual sensors trip a **jaw-opening reflex** to prevent shattering

### Why Many Teeth vs One Bridge
- **High-Resolution Data**: Many individual teeth = tactile map with extreme precision
- **Parallel to Repo Architecture**: Each tooth = individual repo node. Each mechanoreceptor = gadget/tool. Trigeminal nerve = Crown Index hub.

## 2. Japanese Tooth Regeneration Drug — USAG-1 Antibody

Researchers at **Kyoto University Hospital** and **Toregem Biopharma** developed an IV drug that regrows teeth.

### Mechanism
| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **USAG-1** | "Off switch" — inhibits tooth growth by blocking BMP and Wnt pathways |
| **Monoclonal Antibody** | Blocks USAG-1, reactivating dormant "third-set" tooth buds |
| **BMP Signaling** | Essential for dental stem cell differentiation (enamel, dentin, pulp) |
| **Wnt Signaling** | Crucial for supernumerary teeth development and cell fate |

### Clinical Progress
- **Oct 2024**: Human trials began — 30 healthy adult males each missing ≥1 tooth
- **2025/2026**: Phase II — children aged 2-7 with congenital anodontia
- **Goal**: Available to public by **2030**

### Key Signaling Molecules
| Molecule | Role in Tooth "Forging" |
|----------|----------------------|
| USAG-1 | Off switch — inhibits growth to maintain standard tooth count |
| BMP (2, 4, 7) | Powerful inducers of bone and dental hard tissue |
| Wnt Signaling | Development of extra teeth, cell fate decisions |
| LRP5 | Wnt coreceptor for osteoblast specialization |

## 3. Calcium as Signal Messenger

Calcium is not just a building block — it's a **critical signaling messenger** during tooth formation.

- **Initiator**: Intracellular calcium dynamics initiate stem cell differentiation into dental lineages
- **BMP-2 Trigger**: Elevated extracellular calcium increases BMP-2 expression in dental pulp cells
- **Transport Channels**: TRPM7 and SOCE pathways regulate calcium absorption into ameloblasts
- **Regenerative Blueprint**: Calcium phosphate biomaterials stimulate cell migration and differentiation

| Trigeminal nerve | Crown Index hub |
| USAG-1 (off switch) | Rate limiters in forge scripts |
| BMP signaling (growth) | push_file() activating content |
| Dormant tooth buds | Empty repos waiting for index.html |
| Monoclonal antibody | FORGE_AUTOLINK removing barriers |
| Calcium signaling | JSON configs flowing between repos |
| Jaw-opening reflex | Skip logic preventing hub conflicts |
